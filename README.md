# What is this? #

This is the home of the [lutron-integration](packages/lutron-integration/README.md)
and [lutron-integration-tools](packages/lutron-integration-tools/README.md) packages.

If you want to write a library or integration that speaks the Lutron Integration
Protocol, check out lutron-integration.  If you want to use one of the tools that
live here (currently just lutron_monitor), check out lutron-integration-tools.

If you want to use Lutron QS Standalone via Home Assistant, check out the lutronqs
integration in Home Assistant (currently under development).
