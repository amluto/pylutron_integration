# This appears to be completely reliably on QSE-CI-NWK-E with one
# exception: #OUTPUT and ?OUTPUT commands, at least on verrsion
# 8.60, produce no output per se.  The NWK sends a ~OUTPUT, but
# that's entirely indistinguishable from an *unsolicited* message.
#
# The best solution found so far is to avoid ever sending #OUTPUT
# or ?OUTPUT, which, conveniently, is never necessary on QS
# standalone, as #DEVICE and ?DEVICE handle all cases and more.

# Monitoring messages may be arbitrarily interspersed with actual replies, and

# which are asynchronously received monitoring messages.
#
# On the bright side, once we enable prompts, we at least know that all direct
# replies to queries (critically, ?DETAILS) will be received before the QSE>
# prompt.  However, we do not know *which* QSE> prompt they preceed because
# unsolicited messages end with '\r\nQSE>'.  Thanks, Lutron.
#
# We manage to parse the protocol by observing that the incoming stream is a
# stream of messages where each message either ends with b'\r\nQSE>' or
# is just b'QSE>' (no newline).  We further observe that no actual logical
# line of the protocol can start with a Q (everything starts with ~), so
# we can't get confused by a stray Q at the start of a line.
