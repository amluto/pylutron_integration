# A serial number as reported by the integration access point
# is an optional 0x followed by
# 8 hexadecimal digits, with inconsistent case.  The NWK accepts a serial
# number with up to two 0x prefixes followed by any number (maybe up to
# some limit) of zeros followed by case-insensitive hex digits.
#
# Some but not all commands will accept an integration id in place of
# a serial number.  The NWK can get extremely confused if there is an
# integration id that is also a well-formed serial number.
#
# (All of this comes from testing a QSE-CI-NWK-E, but I expect
#  it to be compatible with other integration access points
#  as well.)
#
# This class represents a canonicalized serial number.  It's hashable.
